This project is an automatic plant watering system that utilizes various sensors and a custom-designed control box to regulate and maintain the proper moisture level of plants. The system includes a solenoid valve connected to a water source, a soil moisture sensor, a raindrop sensor, and a 20x4 LCD with various menu displays.

## Features
The control box is designed and 3D printed to house the LCD display and all the necessary components. The LCD display shows various menu displays to indicate the thresholds and current sensor readings. The system can be operated manually by pressing a button or set to water the plants automatically based on time intervals or soil sensor readings exceeding the threshold levels.

The system also features a raindrop sensor that prevents automatic watering if it rains on that particular day. Multiple solenoids and water lines can be connected and adapted to accommodate different plant watering needs.

## Installation
To set up the automatic plant watering system, follow the instructions below:

* Connect the solenoid valve to the water source.
* Connect the soil moisture sensor and raindrop sensor to the control box.
* Adjust the threshold levels for the soil moisture sensor based on the plant's watering needs.
* Install the control box and connect the LCD display to the control box.
* Flash the code to the deserd arduino amd Do all the wiring
* Test the system manually and adjust the settings as necessary.




## Usage
The automatic plant watering system is easy to use and can be customized to meet the needs of different plants. The LCD display provides real-time information on the sensor readings and the watering schedule. The system can be set to water the plants automatically based on time intervals or sensor readings exceeding the threshold levels. The raindrop sensor ensures that the plants are not overwatered during rainy periods.

## Components List

1. Solenoid valve - used to control the water flow to the plants
2. Soil moisture sensor - used to measure the moisture level of the soil
3. Raindrop sensor - used to detect rain and prevent overwatering
4. Arduino board (nano)- used to program and control the system
5. LCD display - used to display the current sensor readings and system status
6. Control box (3D printed) - used to house and protect the electronics
7. Water lines - used to connect the solenoid valve to the water source and plants
8. Power supply - used to power the system (e.g. a 9V battery or AC adapter)
9. Resistors - used to protect the components from excessive current
10. Jumper wires - used to connect the components to the Arduino board.
11. Capacitors - For the debounce
12. LEDS - to show on/off and other status data
13. I2C - for easer wiring the LCD

## Upcoming updates
We're excited to announce that our project is set to embrace the Internet of Things (IoT) in the near future. With IoT integration on the horizon, our system will become even more dynamic and accessible. IoT components will enable real-time data monitoring, control, and remote access, making it easier for users to interact with our system from anywhere in the world. By harnessing the power of platforms like Blynk and Firebase, we're paving the way for a more robust, user-friendly experience. Stay tuned for these exciting IoT developments that will take our project to the next level of connectivity and convenience.
