# Automatic Plant Watering System

This project is an automatic plant watering system that utilizes various sensors and a custom-designed control box to regulate and maintain the proper moisture level of plants. The system includes a solenoid valve connected to a water source, a soil moisture sensor, a raindrop sensor, and a 20x4 LCD with various menu displays.

## Features
The control box is designed and 3D printed to house the LCD display and all the necessary components. The LCD display shows various menu displays to indicate the thresholds and current sensor readings. The system can be operated manually by pressing a button or set to water the plants automatically based on time intervals or soil sensor readings exceeding the threshold levels.

The system also features a raindrop sensor that prevents automatic watering if it rains on that particular day. Multiple solenoids and water lines can be connected and adapted to accommodate different plant watering needs.

## Installation
To set up the automatic plant watering system, follow the instructions below:

* Connect the solenoid valve to the water source.
* Connect the soil moisture sensor and raindrop sensor to the control box.
* Adjust the threshold levels for the soil moisture sensor based on the plant's watering needs.
* Install the control box and connect the LCD display to the control box.
* Test the system manually and adjust the settings as necessary.

## Usage
The automatic plant watering system is easy to use and can be customized to meet the needs of different plants. The LCD display provides real-time information on the sensor readings and the watering schedule. The system can be set to water the plants automatically based on time intervals or sensor readings exceeding the threshold levels. The raindrop sensor ensures that the plants are not overwatered during rainy periods.

## Conclusion
The automatic plant watering system is a highly customizable solution for maintaining healthy plants. With the solenoid valve, soil moisture sensor, raindrop sensor, and LCD display, the system ensures that plants are watered at the appropriate time and in the right amount. The system is easy to install and use, making it a great solution for both novice and experienced gardeners.
